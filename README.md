# Voice-Recognition-Assistant-AI

During my gap year I was craving to do some sort of robot, or some sort of device that I could use on a daily basis. This got me thinking into what sort of things a device could take over so that the job is done as good as or even better than I do it. This is when I thought about “Alexa”, an amazon product. Alexa is used around the house for many non-physical things, it can be used to play music, to switch on/off some lights, to add reminders, to play the news and even play some games. This was the perfect device that I could re-create and re-program as it was small and didn’t need any physics. What I mean by physics is a robot that has to be moving around to achieve a task and, in this case, the device doesn’t need to move to hear my voice. 
After what felt like an hour or two, I finally found the name I would give to this new device: OTTO.

I will do this in 3 separate parts, firstly I will create the circuit diagram of the voice module and the Arduino Uno to test it and see how it works. I will code it and then use the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE software, instead of the speaker, to output replies once I input a voice command. Once it has been tested, it works and I understand it, I will create the second circuit diagram of the speaker. Here I will work with the speaker and SD Card reader. Without using the microphone, I will code the program, input a text voice command and listen to the speaker’s output. If after testing it works and I understand the concept of using these pieces of hardware I can then continue to the next part. The final part will consist of combining both sections together and thus OTTO will be completed.
